# skiptro

This project tries to find the timestamps of tv show intros from a set of audiofiles of a season.

Our end goal would be to that kodi can skip a given tv show intro. 
Dont expect any results on this, we do this mainly for fun :D


## Description
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) does a lot of the heavy lifting with converting files (see `Commands.txt` for used commands).
